Ghostbuster 2 Tripod Trap Build

===This is a WIP, new additions may be added a later time===

Hello Ghostbusters,
  This Repository contains various files and guides to build the Polarity Rectification Tripods from Ghostbusters 2. These files were designed using measurments off the original tripods, with a special thanks to Adam Marish for suppling said reference material for this project. this near perfect recreation was done over the course of 5 years, with many different renditions of the hardware. tho this is an extensive build, I am excited to see other sets made in the community. For those whom were wondering, these are being released to everyone for free, as my gift to this community which has been a part of my life since 2016. many have asked me to include a Tip/Donation path which is found here: (https://paypal.me/TristenLapish?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US) there are no requirements, this path is for those that wish to offer the gratitude.
