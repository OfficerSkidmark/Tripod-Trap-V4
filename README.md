# Tripod-Trap-V4

===This is a WIP, new additions may be added a later time===

Hello Ghostbusters,

  This Repository contains various files and guides to build the Polarity Rectification Tripods from Ghostbusters 2. These files were designed using measurments off the original tripods, with a special thanks to Adam Marish for suppling said reference material for this project. This recreation was done over the course of 5 years, with many different renditions of the hardware. while trying to be as accurate as possible, these files do have some differences to the film as the original prop was modified several times after its appearance in Ghostbusters 2. the noticable differences that has changed since the movie would be the indicator lights. In this I have used close replacments to what is currently on the prop, mine are slightly larger halogen relampable indicators, LED bulbs can be easily found for this style indicator and will be inclued in the BOMs. For those that want a more accurate indicator, I am working on a solution. Due to the lack of source material from the time of the film, it maybe sometime before I figure something out. these files are being released to everyone for free, as my gift to this community which has been a part of my life since 2016. my only ask is to share your builds! many have asked me to include a Tip/Donation path which is found here: (https://paypal.me/TristenLapish?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US) I plan to continue working on these files and adding much more features to these props, any and all donations will be funneled back into this project to improve the designs and make this the best possible recreation i am able to produce.

These files are being released under the Creativecommons-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license, my ask is for others to not produce and sell items from this material as there own.

Special Thanks to:
