===This is a WIP, new additions may be added a later time===

Hello Ghostbusters,

  This Repository contains various files and guides to build the Polarity Rectification Tripods from Ghostbusters 2. These files were designed using measurments off the original tripods, with a special thanks to Adam Marish for suppling said reference material for this project. this recreation was done over the course of 5 years, with many different renditions of the hardware. these files do have some differences to the film as the original prop was modified several times after its appearance in Ghostbusters 2. the noticable differences that has changed since the movie would be the indicator lights. in this i have used close replacments which are slightly larger halogen relampable indicators, LED bulbs can be easily found for this style indicator and will be inclued in BOMs. for those that want a more accurate indicator, i am working on a solution. due to the lack of resource material from the time of the film, it maybe sometime before i figure it out. as a warning this is an extensive build, in both labor and cost, but I am excited to see other sets made in the community. For those whom were wondering, these are being released to everyone for free, as my gift to this community which has been a part of my life since 2016. my only ask is to share your builds! many have asked me to include a Tip/Donation path which is found here: (https://paypal.me/TristenLapish?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US) this path is for those that wish to offer the gratitude. and any donations will be cycled back into this project for PCB designs and further prototyping
